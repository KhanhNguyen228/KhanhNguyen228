Focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
#### Business Objectives
- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help inﬂuence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
#### Deliverables
- A clear summary of the business task
- A description of all data sources used
- Documentation of all data sources used 
- A summary of analysis
- Supporting visualizations and key findings
- High-level content recommendations based on the analysis
#### Key stakeholders
- Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Oﬃcer
- Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Step 2: PREPARE
#### Information on data source
- This data set is available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?resource=download)
- Generated by 30 respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016
- Data collected includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring

#### Is the data ROCCC?
ROCCC stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited.
- Reliable: has only 30 respondents
- Original: provided by Amazon Mechanical Turk (3rd party)
- Comprehensive: this data set has a usability rating of 10.00 identified by Kaggle
- Current: data was generated in 2016
- Cited: unknown
#### Accessibility and Data Privacy
The data is identified as open-source and published under the CC0: Public Domain license. This data can be used freely for our analysis without asking for permission.

## Step 3: PROCESS
#### Files used in this project
- dailyActivity_merged
- heartrate_seconds_merged
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged
- sleepDay_merged
- weightLogInfo_merged

I created a new file called 'hourly_activity' by using Excel Power Query to merge 3 files: hourlyCalories_merged, hourlyIntensities_merged, and hourlySteps_merged, then imported all files to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to continue processing and analyzing.

**Refer to the links below for further processing in SQL**

[Create 'daily_activity_cleaned'](https://github.com/KhanhNguyen228/Personal_projects/blob/main/Cleaning_daily_activity.sql)

[Create 'weigt_log_cleaned'](https://github.com/KhanhNguyen228/Personal_projects/blob/main/Cleaning_weight_log_info.sql)

[Create 'tracked_days'](https://github.com/KhanhNguyen228/Personal_projects/blob/main/creating_tracked_days.sql)

## Step 4: ANALYZE
**Using SQL to analyze this data set**

**Refer to the link below for further analyzing in SQL**

[Analyzing daily activities, heart rate, sleep, weight, average minutes for each activity, average steps of each user, most active time](https://github.com/KhanhNguyen228/Personal_projects/blob/main/Analyzing.sql)

[Analyzing each type of activity's time and the correlation between that and calories](https://github.com/KhanhNguyen228/Personal_projects/blob/main/Analyzing_intensity_and_correlation.sql)

## Step 5: SHARE
Using Tableau in building dashboards to share key findings

Refer to the link below:

[Data visualization with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/giakhanh2208/viz/GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject_16686921201920/Story1)

**Key findings**
- All respondents tracked their physical activities, including total steps, distance traveled, and time spent doing very active, moderately active, light active, sedentary, and sedentary activities, as well as total calories burned.
- 24 respondents tracked their sleeping patterns, 14 respondents tracked their heart rate, and only 8 respondents logged in their weight.
- Most respondents used the app consistently; only 1 respondent used the device for just 4 days.
- Respondents clocked an average of 7600 steps, which is approximately 5.5 km in distance, and burned an average of 2300 calories a day. Only seven people took more than 10,000 steps per day, which is the recommended amount. 
- Sedentary activities take up to 81% of the total amount of time, while very active and fairly active activities are just approximately 2% and 1%, respectively.
- Most respondents were involved in dynamic activities from around 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM & 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The hourly intensity also increases gradually from 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM and starts to decrease from 8:00 PM onward.
- There's a slight positive correlation between the amount of time per activity and calories burned. The more they are active, the more calories they burn.
## Step 6: ACT
### Recommendations
- All respondents used the tracking device throughout the day, not only when they did exercises. Bellabeat should make its product fashionable in order to enhance users' appearances.
- With only eight users logging in their weight, Bellabeat should consider a campaign that focuses on tracking as well as creating an exercise schedule to achieve a weight loss goal.
- 24 respondents tracked their sleeping patterns; it could be related to the device's battery or it could be uncomfortable to wear during sleep. Bellabeat should improve the battery life or conduct research into how to make it more comfortable.
- 14 respondents tracked their heart rate; Bellabeat should consider offering reminders and giving warnings if there's a suspected fluctuation in heart rate to prevent an imminent heart attack.
- Because sedentary activities account for up to 81% of total time spent, Bellabeat may consider a personalized pop-up notification to remind and encourage users to be active.
